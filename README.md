# Cat
Learning basics of category theory by coding

### Sample discrete category

```haskell
-- Category
cat Demo

-- Objects
obj a & b & c
obj d
```
Where **cat** is the keyword for category and **obj** is for objects. Multiple objects are separated from each other by **&**.

Names are case sensitive and UTF-8 friendly.

The following symbols may be used in names:

| Symbol | Name   |
| ------ | ------ |
|   a-z  |        |
|   0-9  |        |
|        | Space  |
|    ,   | Comma  |

By default there is always **large category** containing all declared **small categories**.
