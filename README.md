# Cat
Learning basics of category theory by coding

### Sample discrete category

```haskell
-- Category
cat Demo

-- Objects
obj a & b & c
obj d
```
Where **cat** is the keyword for category and **obj** is for objects. Multiple objects are separated from each other by **&**.

Entity names may contain the following symbols:

| Symbol | Name   |
| ------ | ------ |
|        | Space  |
|    ,   | Comma  |

</p>

By default there is always **large category** containing all declared **small categories**.
